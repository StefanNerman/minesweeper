What is this project?

This is one of my first javascript projects and it's just a simple minesweeper game. 


How to start the game?

First you need to select your difficulty using the button in the top left corner, after that click on "new game" button and then you can start playing. Left-click to open a tile and right-click to flag it, when all bombs are cleared a sign will appear that says "YOU WIN!", if you hit a bomb the game ends and a sign will appear that says "YOU LOSE!".

Bugs:

I didn't have the time to fix all the bugs in the game so here's a some of the bugs in the game: timer doesn't stop after game ends, if you click on a tile before starting the game the play area streches (if you press new game the bug gets fixed), styling isn't done for all elements, you can sort-of continue the game after you lose, the "best time" and "last time" signs are broken. I might fix all the issues later if I have the time, but I propably won't because the game is still playable and I've got other stuff to do.
